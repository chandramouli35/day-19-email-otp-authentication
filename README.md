# 🚀 Day 19 — Email OTP Verification with Retry Logic

Secure OTP flows are everywhere — fintech logins, SaaS onboarding, and user authentication. Today’s build replicates that exact UX in React, with full control over state and flow.

### 🔧 What I built
- Email input form with basic validation
- OTP dispatch trigger with countdown timer
- 6-digit controlled OTP input
- Retry flow: Resend OTP after expiry
- Success & error toasts for feedback
- Tailwind-styled layout with clean state transitions

### 🧠 Why this matters
This isn’t just a form. It’s a trust gateway.

- Users expect clarity and feedback when logging in
- Backend simulation shows real-world flow control
- Helps build scalable auth UX without bloated libraries

### ⚙️ Stack & Concepts
- **React.js** — useState, useEffect
- **Axios** — mock API integration
- **Tailwind CSS** — for layout finesse
- **Timer logic** — reused with modular hooks

### 🏁 Outcome
Authentication logic shipped with polish. Production-grade frontend that can slot into any real project right now.
